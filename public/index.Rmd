## Install R and RStudio

From **NIWA Apps** install ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/R_logo.svg/2000px-R_logo.svg.png){width=2%} (**R**) and  ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Antu_rstudio.svg/2000px-Antu_rstudio.svg.png){width=2%} (**RStudio**), I found both under **Programming**.



**R** is a computer language and **RStudio** is a widely used Graphical User Interface (GUI) that calls it in the background.

To check everything is working open up **RStudio** ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Antu_rstudio.svg/2000px-Antu_rstudio.svg.png){width=2%}, if you use Windows use the Search Windows box to locate. 

Once opened you should see something like this ![](rstudio.png)

The section with the curser is called the **Console**. To test all is working, where the curser is type `3 + 4` and press enter. If all has gone well you should see something like this ![](rstudio2.png)

You can now close **RStudio** down as you are already for the first session.

## Basics

### Some terminology

- **Console**: the text-based interface between you and the computer. This is where you tell the computer what to do.

- **Script**: the code you write telling the computer what to do.

- **Run**: the act of actually implementiong your code telling the computer what to do.

- **Syntax**: how the language is written and what characters mean.

- **Function**: sort of like a rule that dictates what you want to calculate.

- **Argument**: an object you would give a function to calculate something.

- **Package**: a collection/suite of functions/commands. 

### Don't have a dirty workspace

In **RStudio**. **Tools >> Global Options** 

- Uncheck *Restore .RData into workspace at startup*
- Uncheck *Restore most recently opened project at startup*
- Uncheck *Always save history (even when not saving .RData)*
- Set *Save workspace to .RData on exit:* to Never

### Basic operations

```{r basic, eval = TRUE}
## Start a line with hash and you can write your own comments
## This helps future you understand what present you was doing.
## To add two numbers
3 + 4 ## When run the number 7 should appear in your console
## Multiply two numbers
3 * 4
## "Create" and object x and give it the value 3
x <- 3
## So what is x? Type x and find out
x
## What is x - 1?
x - 1
## To create a vector of numbers 1--5
y <- c(1,2,3,4,5) 
## or
z <- 1:5
## Print them to the console
y
z
## times y by x
y*x
```

### Errors

Honestly they are in English!

Try typing your name into the console

```{r error,error=TRUE}
Charlotte ## An Error should be printed to your console
```

Why is this? It's because `Charlotte` doesn't exist in **R** because I haven't created it.

Armed with a little common sense most Errors are easy to decipher. If not ask Google...

## Reading data into R

### Setting your "working directory"

- In **RStudio** follow **Session >> Set Working Directory >> Choose Directory...** 

- Or in your console run `setwd("path/to/your/directory")`
